I spent nine years in investment banking
understanding how the top 1% manage
their money. I studied finance at
university and trained as a professional
accountant. And after all of that, I
discovered you don't need to be rich.
You don't need a finance degree and you
definitely don't need to love numbers to
manage your money like the wealthy do.
You just need a simple road map and the
commitment to follow it. So, in this
video, I'm pulling back the curtain on
everything I learned in the last decade
and the exact strategies the top 1% use
to manage their finances. This is the
only video you need to start building
wealth regardless of your starting
point. So, here's what we're going to
cover. First, we're going to get
brutally honest about where you stand
right now, your real net worth, your
true income, and your spending, and
whether you're actually building wealth
or slowly bleeding money without
realizing it. We'll also come up with a
very clear plan to tackle any debt that
you have. Next, we'll get really clear
about your financial goals. This is all
about the life that you want to build.
No restrictions, no holding yourself
back. We're going to get really clear
and really specific. From there, we'll
build an action plan around your goals.
We'll cover a 12-month plan and also a
monthby-month check-in to make sure
you're on track. We will then talk about
where you can keep your money so that it
pushes you towards your life goals
faster. Because let's be honest, if it's
just sitting in a dead savings account
right now, then you're moving further
away from your goals instead of towards
them. We'll then move on to investing
because every year you delay is a year
you lose freedom. I'll show you when to
start, how to know you're ready, and why
it matters more than you think. And then
we'll move on to two of the biggest
traps most people fall into. Car buying,
which is the hidden wealth killer that
wipes out savings. And I'll show you how
to avoid getting ripped off. And
finally, we'll put the endless rent
versus buy debate to bed. How to decide
whether buying a house makes sense for
you or whether renting will set you
freer faster. And it's one thing to
listen, but it's another to actually
apply everything that I'm saying to your
own finances. So, as we go through, I'll
share examples, mini quizzes, and
practical tools to help you put
everything into action. If you want to
explore any of the templates or the
guides that I mentioned, they're all
part of my financial well-being toolkit,
which gives you all the tools that you
need to manage your money, like the 1%.
I've left the details in the video
description if you want to check it out.
By the end of this video, you can
consider yourself financially literate
and you'll have the exact road map to
build a secure financial base. Okay,
let's get into it. Starting with section
one, understanding your financial. Now,
this is incredibly incredibly important
and the very first thing that you have
to do. There's a quote that I love. If
you do not know where you come from,
then you don't know where you are. And
if you don't know where you are, then
you don't know where you're going. And
this couldn't be more true when it comes
to your finances. Yet, most people
ignore this step. Before you can make
any real progress, you have to know
exactly where you're standing today.
This is about taking a clear, honest
snapshot of your money, your income,
your spending, your net worth, and most
importantly, the gap between them. I'm
going to put some numbers and a tracker
on the screen. There are a lot of
trackers and tools out there. Use
whatever works for you. But the key
here, absolutely key, is to keep it
ridiculously simple. That's the only way
you will actually stay on track with
this and it won't feel like a chore. So,
there are three numbers that should live
rent free in your head. your net income
per year, your expenses per year, and
your income surplus or deficit for the
year. And you might be wondering why are
we doing this on a yearly basis? The
reason is because doing it on a yearly
basis gives you the truest picture of
your finances. It captures everything
from the one-off expenses, the surprise
bills, and all those little things that
would slip through the cracks if you
only looked at this month on month. It's
the most honest, accurate way to do
this. Start with your net income. That's
the money actually coming in after tax.
It's what lands in your bank account.
Include salary, any side hustles,
dividends, freelancing work, rental
income, interest. Add it all up across
the year. So, if you're on a salary,
take your monthly pay slip number and
multiply it by 12. Then look at your
yearly expenses. You can use an app or
just scroll through your bank
statements. Look at both the regular
bills and the irregular spending you
usually forget about. Now, subtract that
spending from your income. That number
you get, that is everything. It
essentially tells you whether you're
moving forward or you're staying stuck.
If it's negative, you're in income
deficit, meaning you're spending more
than you're earning. Over time, that
will chip away at your savings. It will
increase your debt and it will pull you
further from financial freedom. If it's
positive, that's your income surplus.
That's the money you have left over. And
one thing to add, when it comes to
savings and investments, although
they're not technically expenses,
treating them this way for this exercise
and for this step helps you stay
consistent with savings because it
builds a good habit as you know what
you're capable of. And then for the
coming months, you can aim for more than
that. That is essentially your baseline.
We'll come on to this in more detail
when we're looking at the future 12
months and the forecast. So here in this
example, we have
4,851 as the income surplus. That's
money left over. And the bigger that
surplus, the bigger the gap between your
income and your spending, the faster you
can save, the faster you can invest, the
faster you can buy back time, options,
freedom, independence. We'll go into all
of that in more detail in the coming
sections. Now, onto your net worth. Net
worth, really simple. It's everything
you own, i.e. your assets minus
everything that you owe i.e. your
liabilities. Assets are things that you
own that have value like savings,
investments, property. List down all of
the major purchases and the value of
that asset. Liabilities on the other
hand are debts and obligations that take
money out of your pocket. So think
mortgage, think car loans, credit card
balances, personal loans. The difference
is your net worth. And over time you
want your net worth number to increase
and have an upward trend. You want to
keep using your income to buy assets
because whilst your income is important,
income is the thing that buys you your
lifestyle, but it's net worth that buys
you your freedom. That's why this is
super important. It doesn't matter where
you're starting today, what matters is
that from this point forward, your net
worth is just moving in the right
direction. Later in this video, when we
talk about investing, when we talk about
buying a home, buying a car, you'll see
this pattern show up again and again.
Every financial decision you make either
builds your assets or it builds your
liabilities. Understanding the
difference properly is one of the
fastest ways to start building real
wealth instead of just feeling busy with
money. And it all starts right here by
taking a really honest snapshot of where
you are today. Now, one more thing I
wanted to include here which often gets
ignored is your money personality. The
way you view life and view situations
has a huge impact whether you realize it
or not on how you save, what you spend
on, how you invest, and even what feels
safe or exciting when it comes to money.
And the more you understand it, the
easier it is to build a money strategy
that fits around you and that actually
lasts and doesn't feel hard to keep up
with. There are loads of quizzes online
and they'll give you an idea of what
your personality traits are. Most of
them also suggest action points on what
to look out for and things to be
cautious of to make sure you're taking
the path of least resistance when it
comes to managing your money. Here's the
one that's included. It asks you 20
questions and based on the way you
answer it, it will bucket you into one
of five money personalities. So at a
high level, you have the contemporary.
So this person loves living in the
moment. They enjoy spending. They're
generous with their money. Then you have
the enterpriser. Highly goal oriented,
calculated with your spending, and
always planning ahead. You have the
minimalist, which values simplicity and
security. They're cautious with money
and very laser focused on building a
really strong and stable future. You
have the realist which is practical and
they are practical to the core. They
prefer safe, steady financial choices
that keep them really grounded and
protected. And then you have the
socialite. They love the finer things.
They love making memories with others
and for them money is best spent on
things like experiences, celebrations,
and pretty much just living life to the
fullest. Let me know which one you think
you are closest to. It turns out that
I'm the enterpriser, which honestly it
made a lot of sense. The quick follow-up
advice it gave me based on my result,
and these might get you thinking about
your own habits, too. It was firstly,
look ahead with your numbers to make
sure you're actually on track for the
lifestyle that you want. And this is
something that I'm actually going to
walk you through how to do in one of the
upcoming sections. It also said, unpack
the details behind all of the financial
products. And you may be used to doing
it all on your own, but bouncing ideas
off an expert can't hurt either, which
is pretty accurate. I'd say this
specific one is part of my financial
well-being toolkit. You can also find
plenty of other ones online as well.
Okay, moving on to section two. Having a
plan for your debt. This is super
important. And if you have any debt,
then a bit of structure and a bit of
strategy can make all the difference.
And that's exactly what we're going to
put into place now. So, the first thing
to get your head around is that not all
debt is bad. Some kind of debt can
actually build your future if you manage
them well. Think about a student loan
that lifts your earning potential or a
loan that helps you own an asset likely
to appreciate over time. These kind of
debts, they could work in your favor and
can make you more money. And then other
debts work in the opposite way. They
cost you money. So, I'm talking about
things like credit card debt, payday
loans, short-term finance deals. They
all seem harmless at first, but the
costs really stack up behind the scenes.
So, knowing the difference helps you
prioritize. If you've got multiple
debts, you need to know what's helping
you and what's hurting you. So, step
one, get all the information in one
place. Use a spreadsheet, use a
notebook, an app. It doesn't matter what
you use as long as you're using
something to track it. And for every
debt that you have, jot down the total
amount you owe, the interest rate, the
minimum payment, the due date, and
whether there's any flexibility on that
credit card or on that loan, like 0%
offers or payment holidays. Once
everything's laid out in front of you,
you can actually see it. You can
actually understand it. You can work
with it. So now it's time to choose a
repayment strategy. Two main ones. First
is the debt avalanche. So for the
avalanche method, what you're doing is
you're taking your debts and you're
ranking them from highest to lowest in
terms of interest rate. So if I click
here, you can see how the order of the
debts are reshuffled. It's ranking it
from highest to lowest based on interest
rate. So what you do is you put as much
money as you can towards the top one
that is charging the most whilst you're
paying the minimum on the others and
then you work your way down. The
avalanche method is the most
mathematically efficient way out and it
will save you the most amount of money.
The second option you have is a debt
snowball. So for this, you take your
loans and you pay it off in terms of
smallest to largest in terms of loan
size. So if I click this, you'll see how
the order has reshuffled. So this is how
it goes in practice. You start by paying
off your smallest at first, ignoring the
interest rate, and you get a quick win
by paying that smaller amount off
quicker than you would a larger amount.
Then you roll your payments over to the
next one and the next one, and that's
the order it works. It's a more
emotional approach, but it works because
it's building confidence by seeing you
knock off the loans one by one in order
of debt size. And if you're sitting
there thinking, which one should I pick?
Honestly, the one that helps you stick
with it. Snowball if you need
motivation. Avalanche if you want to
save money. I personally am all about
the mathematically efficient one,
especially with high interest rate debt.
But if it means you end up not taking
action, I rather you go for the debt
snowball. Both are better than doing
nothing. And one more practical tip for
here. If you have credit card debt, look
into a balance transfer card. This lets
you move your existing debt to a new
card with 0% interest for a very limited
period. It doesn't erase your debt, but
it just gives you more breathing room,
and you can stop interest from piling up
whilst you're paying it off. Be mindful
of any transfer fees. Just make sure
you've got a really clear plan to clear
it before the 0% period ends. And
finally, to wrap up this section, I
wanted to mention debit and credit cards
because how you use them really shapes
your financial habits over time. So, a
debit card spends your own money. It
pulls cash straight from your account,
and once that money's gone, it's gone. A
credit card spends the bank's money.
They're essentially lending you money.
And if you don't pay it back on time,
they're going to charge you for that
privilege. If you use this wisely, the
credit card, you pay it back on time, in
full at the end of every single month or
your payment period. Credit cards can be
a really smart tool because they offer
points, they offer cash back, they offer
travel rewards, basically free stuff for
spending money you were going to spend
anyway. So, if you're buying your weekly
groceries or your train ticket or your
recurring phone bill and you already
have the money, then using a credit card
and then paying off immediately is a
really good move. But, and this is key,
if you can't afford to pay for something
outright in cash, you probably shouldn't
be buying it with debt either. There are
very few exceptions in my view and they
are the big pillars. Property, health
care, education and anything else that
is going to make you more money.
Everything else save first, spend later.
Okay. So, if you've gone through these
sections, you now have a incredibly
crystal clear view of where you stand
and now you can look ahead with
confidence and a clear direction. Okay.
So, moving on to the bit that puts
everything else into place. Section
three, setting your financial goals.
This is unbelievably important because
if you don't know what you're aiming for
or what you're working towards, it's
almost impossible to make the right
decisions with your money. That's the
first thing. And second thing, where you
put your money, whether it's in savings
or in investments, it depends entirely
on when you need it. So before we dive
into savings accounts, investment
platforms, stocks, bonds, I want you to
hit pause for a moment and take five
minutes, grab a pen and paper, your
phone, a spreadsheet, whatever you like,
and write down your goals. Every single
goal that you have for yourself, write
it down. Even the ones that feel
impossible, the ones that other people
are telling you are unrealistic, ones
that you might be doubting if you could
achieve there. Write it all down. And
don't let anything deter you at the
moment. Pause this video if you want to
pause it whilst you do it right now. And
then next to each goal, jot down a rough
idea of when you want to achieve it. A
time frame. This might sound like a
small step, but is everything because
the when of your goal changes the how of
how you should manage your money. And
this timeline matters so much because
the longer the time frame, the more
powerful your money becomes. So let's
say one of your goals is 20 years away.
Maybe it's retirement. Maybe it's
funding your kids' university years down
the line. For long-term goals like that,
you've got one of the most powerful
forces on your side, and that is time.
And this is backed by a century of
financial history. Over the last 100
years, anyone who invested their money
into the S&P 500 and held their
investments for a minimum of 20 years
never lost money. Not once. In every 20
years stretch, the market delivered a
positive return. And even in the weakest
period, the return was still over 4%.
Except for one unusual case where if
someone sold their investment in 1948
and bought in 1928, they would have
returned
2.86% rather than the minimum 4% they
would have got in any of the other
20-year periods. 79% of the time, the
returns were 8% or higher, and 59% of
the time they were 10% or higher. Why am
I saying this? Let's translate those
numbers into real life. So, if you had
invested a 100,000 and left it alone for
20 years, a 4.4% return would have
turned that 100,000 into
219,000. An 8% return would have turned
it into
460,000 and a 10% return would have
turned that 100,000, your 100,000 into
670,000. That's nearly 7x your savings.
It's about making your money work hard
for you and letting the market do what
it's historically done to get you to
your goals faster. And say, okay, if you
don't have 20 years to save that money
and invest it, what if the goal that you
have is 10 years away, like moving into
a bigger place or starting your own
business, the data still holds solid.
Most 10-year periods in the market
delivered really strong positive returns
and in most cases double digits. There
were a few exceptions. If you, for
instance, invested in 1998 and sold in
2008, so you held it for that 10-year
period, you sold just after the 2008
financial crisis, that would have been a
small loss around 1.4%. But those kind
of cases, they're outliers. They're not
the norm. Now, compare that to a
one-year holding period. Say you'd
invested for any one year, this shows a
completely different story. If you're in
the market for any one year, you can see
the returns are unpredictable and you
really don't know what it will be in any
given year. You can make a lot, you can
lose a lot. You just don't know. So, if
you've got a short-term goal, something
happening in the next year or 2 years,
and the market probably isn't the right
place for that money. And then that
circles us back right to why setting a
clear timeline matters. Because once you
know when you want something to happen,
you can pick the right strategy for that
goal. So, short-term goals, anything
that's happening in the next five years.
So, this is your emergency fund. This is
that holiday that you've been dreaming
about coming up. This is Christmas
presents, maybe a house deposit that you
want to pull together soon. This is all
short-term money, and it needs to be in
a place that's very safe and accessible,
not at the mercy of stock market swings.
Then you have medium-term goals, and
this is for anything that you're
planning or any goals that you've
written down that are between 5 to 15
years away. So maybe a bigger home,
school fees, starting your own business,
that maybe one day dream that you
actually want to turn into a plan. This
is where you want your money. Working a
little bit harder and your chances of
riding out the ups and downs of the
market improve massively. Your chances
of beating inflation, protecting your
money's future value. They get a lot
stronger during this timeline. So for
goals during this period, you want to
start looking into investment accounts
that match your country's tax rules and
your personal comfort with risk. And
we'll go into that in one of the
sections coming up as well. And then
there's long-term goals. So this is
anything 15 years and beyond. This is
retirement. This is building wealth for
your future. This is giving your money
the time and space to grow in a serious
way. When you're planning this far out,
you just have to be investing your
money. you're leaving a lot of money on
the table if you're not. So, for now,
for this section, all I want you to do
is have your goals written out, all the
goals that you want to achieve, the time
frame, how many years to get there, and
just right next to it, whether it's a
short-term, medium, or long-term goal
based on the outline I just gave you.
Okay, so now we're moving on to one of
my favorite sections because we're
turning everything that we had planned
into reality now. And this is where it
all starts to feel real. Up to now, or
up until now, we figured out where you
stand and what you want. Now, we turn
that into a practical plan. One that
actually helps you build the life you're
aiming for. Welcome to budgeting. I know
the word budgeting alone can sound
tedious. It sounds restrictive, but when
you really understand why you're doing
it, budgeting can actually be one of the
most freeing things you can do with your
money. And the best way to explain this
and to convince you of this is to use a
car analogy. So you've just outlined
your goals. Think of all those goals
that you'd outlined as different
destinations. These are the places that
you want to reach. Now we're going to
prepare a 12 month forecast looking
forward. And essentially that's the road
that you're on that will get you to
those goals. It forces you to look
beyond the next week or the next month.
When you can see your whole year ahead,
the next 12 months, you start to notice
patterns and opportunities that you'd
otherwise miss. You spot the bumps in
the road before you hit them, like your
annual insurance renewal, like holiday
spending or that wedding you've got
coming up in August that is abroad. What
we'll also have is monthly check-ins.
Those are like the dashboard inside your
car telling you how fast you're going,
whether you've got enough fuel, if
you're drifting off course. Without a
map, a road, and a dashboard, you're
just driving aimlessly. You're hoping
you'll end up somewhere good. And we've
all seen how that works with money. It
usually doesn't. So, how do we go about
this? The first is creating your
baseline. Essentially, this is your what
happens if I keep going like this plan.
You take what you know from the last 12
months, your income, your spending, your
habits, and you project it forward into
the next 12 months. Once you know what
your year looks like, you can then start
doing something about it. So now we're
going to split the savings and
investments off separately. We're doing
the savings and investments first. This
way you can tweak the forecast until all
of your surplus that you may have had
before is allocated ahead of time. It
isn't something that just happens as an
afterthought. And once you've done that,
you ask yourself the strategic
questions. This is where you ask your
questions like, can I shift more money
into savings or debt repayments? Can I
cut back spending on areas that I know
are coming up so that I can save more?
Which spending categories specifically
for the things I know I'll have to pay
can I reduce? You want to in this
exercise focus mostly on the things that
you know you have to pay your needs
essentially your essential living costs
because everything else will fluctuate
massively month. These are the expenses
that you know you can reduce and will
have a really big impact over the course
of 12 months. And I want to go into more
detail for a second about some easy wins
that can make a huge difference. So one
of them utilities, cell phone, home,
internet, everyone has to pay them. You
definitely need these things. But what
you can do is just compare the same
packages with other providers and use
that to negotiate your package to make
sure you are getting the absolute best
deal on the market. If you call them up
and ask, they are very likely going to
do something for you because they rather
keep you as a customer than have you
leave for a competitor. Another
category, easy win, groceries. You can
decrease your spending by looking at
different stores around you, seeing if
you can buy things at different places,
buying staples when there are discounts,
swapping your Waitro shop for an Audi or
a little shop. It may not seem like a
huge difference, but if it's something
you use regularly, it will stack up over
time. The good thing about making these
adjustments now after you've done your
forecast is that they're very targeted
because now you've got a reason. You
know exactly what needs to shift. And
then when we move on to one of the next
parts, which is how much you need to
invest, then you could come back here
again and keep tweaking this until
you're happy with balancing the
short-term, i.e. the next 12 month
spending with your long-term goals.
Okay. So, once you've mapped out your
yearly forecast, the next step is moving
on to monthly check-ins. It's through
these monthly check-ins where you spot
little changes, a higher electricity
bill, a subscription that you forgot
about, a little overspend on dinners
out, and then you can catch them and
course correct whilst it's still easy to
fix. So, what I'm going to share now on
the screen is a very simple budgeting
framework that I use. You can use
whatever makes sense for you, but what's
really important is just keeping this
super simple. So, I love the 503020 rule
because it helps you visualize your
spending by categorizing your income or
your take-home pay into three buckets.
Essentially, what the 503020 rule is is
that 50% of your take-home pay should be
going towards your fundamental needs. So
things like groceries, rents,
transportation, everything that you need
for your basic living, 30% into your
fund spending, things that are nice to
have but not necessary like going out to
eat, what going to the movies, any
social plans. And then finally, 20%
should go towards the future you. So
this is savings, investments, and extra
debt repayments. That 50, 30, 20%
allocation, it's not a hard and fast
rule. It's just a benchmark. You can
tweak it completely to match your
lifestyle, but I want to show you how it
works with the monthly checket. Let's
say in this instance, you put all your
numbers into a spreadsheet and you find
that your fundamentals add up to 59% of
your take-home pay, but your target was
50%, your fund spending is 30%, and your
future U is at 11%, but your target was
20%. Now you know compared to your
target goals that you have that there
are some adjustments that you need to
make to stay closer to your goals. Maybe
this is the first month tracking and
you'll need to tweak the percentages to
make them more sustainable for you. Or
maybe you'll find areas where you can
tighten your discretionary spending.
When it comes to monthly check-ins, the
three questions I recommend asking
yourself when you're doing these monthly
budgets is going through your fun and
your fundamental needs categories and
through every line item asking yourself,
do I need this? If I do need it, can I
live with less of it? And can I get the
same thing for less? When you combine
your 12-month forecast with your regular
monthly check-ins, you're creating a
very practical road map that guides you
constantly towards your financial goals.
By the way, if you are someone who does
not have the time or the energy to build
the spreadsheets or the systems from
scratch, then you can use the ones that
I have. They are ready to use and they
all come with the financial well-being
toolkit. This is an online toolkit
designed to give you everything you need
from the step-by-step guides, the
calculators, the tools, the spreadsheets
to take your finances from chaos to
complete 100% crystal clarity. What
you've seen or the glimpses that you've
seen so far is about 5% of what is
included in the toolkit. Inside there's
a full road map that takes you through
goal setting, through saving plans,
through debt strategies, through
investing foundations, everything step
by step and it's designed to give you
total clarity without all the overwhelm.
This is the kind of thing that I would
have killed to have when I was figuring
out my finances. It's super frustrating
that to create a financial plan for
yourself or from a financial advisor,
it's really expensive. So, I wanted to
build something that takes you through
the process where you can create your
own financial plan, understand your own
finances at literally a fraction of the
investment of what it usually would
cost. So, I hope you love it. If you

able to use that code and get a huge
chunk off of their toolkit. Moving on to
the next section, where to save your
money. Now, let's talk about banks.
Because when it comes to saving your
money, most people look at it in the
wrong way. When you keep your money in a
bank account, they're not just storing
it safely for you in some vault in the
basement with your name on it. They're
using it. They take out that money and
they lend it out. They lend it out to
someone buying a house. They lend it out
to someone starting a business, someone
financing a car. and they charge a lot
more in interest than what they're
paying you to leave it sitting there.
The difference, the gap between what
they charge borrowers and what they pay
savers is called the net interest
margin. Just fancy term for something
very simple, which is just their profit.
So, when you're earning 1% on your
savings and then that money is being
lent out to someone who's paying 6% on a
loan, that 5% margin is essentially the
bank's payday. And if you're not
shopping around essentially for the best
rates, if you're just leaving your money
wherever it happens to land, then you're
basically handing them that extra margin
for free. You want to keep as much of
that as you can. The first thing to do
is compare rates. Use independent
comparison sites, real ones, not just
whatever your current bank's marketing
page is telling you. And when you're
comparing, think about what you actually
need. If you want access to your money
at any time, look at easy access saving
accounts. If you're happy to lock away
your money for a little while, look at
notice accounts where you agree to give
for say 60 or 90 days notice before you
take it out in exchange for a slightly
better rate. If you're in the US, you
might look at certificates of deposit,
CDs, which also tends to offer better
rates as well. But remember that money
is usually locked in for a fixed period.
So, while it may not be right for your
emergency fund, it could be ideal if
you've got a future expense coming up in
the next year or two, like a tax bill as
well coming up in the next couple of
months. My number one tip here, don't
just look at traditional banks. Online
banks and investment platforms as well,
they're increasingly offering
competitive cash accounts. I know that
sounds a bit odd using an investment
platform to save your money, but
especially in Europe where traditional
bank rates are painfully low, these
newer platforms can offer much more
attractive returns on your savings. So,
we're talking 3 to 4% interest compared
to the 1% you might get from a high
street bank. There are fewer overheads
for these online banks, so they can pass
on more of their margin to you as a
customer. So, that is the savings. What
to look out for, where to keep your
savings, at what point do you stop
saving and start investing? Section six,
when to invest, but when should I
actually start investing? This is the
milliondoll question. Sometimes quite
literally, and I'm going to give you a
clear road map that balances protection
and growth. So, step one, first up, save
up to one month's worth of your living
expenses. Before anything else, save one
month. Think of this as your financial
breathing room, just enough to help you
sleep at night while you tackle the next
steps. This isn't your fully funded
emergency fund yet, but it's just your
first line of defense. Then move on to
step two, and that is paying off the
high interest rate debt. Target any debt
with interest rates above 8%. That's
what I mean by high interest rate debt.
Why 8%? Because mathematically it's very
difficult for your investments to
consistently outperform this rate after
also taking into account inflation. That
20% credit card debt, it's literally
draining your wealth faster than you can
build it. Those highinterest personal
loans, same thing. So paying these off
is essentially giving yourself a
guaranteed return equal to the interest
rate. That's a deal that you won't find
in any investment market. And then step
three, build and invest simultaneously.
Here's where things can start happening
at multiple fronts. So once you've got
that first month's worth of your living
expenses saved and you've got your high
interest rate debt handled, you could
then start moving on to multiple fronts.
Continue building your emergency fund
towards your target, and that's usually
3 to six months worth of your living
expenses. And you could start investing
for your long-term goals at the same
time. This approach is so much more
motivating than just finishing one thing
completely before starting another
method because you get to see your
progress in different areas of your
financial life simultaneously. So maybe
70% of your surplus goes towards
finishing your emergency fund while 30%
goes towards working for your
investments. The exact split depends on
your comfort level and timeline, but you
want to as much as possible keep trying
to move forward. And that's why I
recommend doing them simultaneously
after getting to a point you're
comfortable with. Now, moving on to the
next part where we put the money we have
in our life towards our life goals. And
this is section seven. So, let's get
real about those big dreams you're
saving for. Whether it's buying a home,
sending your kids to college, or sipping
margaritas on the beach during early
retirement, how much realistically
should you actually be putting aside to
reach those goals? The trick here is to
work backwards. Ask yourself three
simple questions. First, what's my goal?
We've already gone through this. So
whether that's a new home, world travel,
financial freedom, what is that goal?
Secondly, how much will it cost? Put a
number next to it. And third, when do
you need it by? 5 years, 10 years, 20 or
30 years. If you're not sure about that
second question, how much that dream or
that goal will cost? Use an online
calculator or even an AI assistant chach
to calculate a ballpark figure for you.
That's good enough to get started with.
Now, let's break this down with a real
example. So, imagine you want to buy a
home in 10 years and you need 50,000 for
the down payment. How do we figure out
therefore what to invest to get you
there? Let's play around with some
numbers. If you invest 300 monthly for
10 years at a conservative 7% return,
you'll contribute 36,000 of your own
money over time. But the amount you have
available, i.e. your investment pot at
the end of it will grow to approximately
50,000. You don't need a lump sum
investment today at all to reach that
goal. But what if your budget only
allows for 200 a month? Then, as you can
see here, you need to invest about 7,500
upfront to still reach that 50,000 goal
because you're investing less on a
monthly basis. So, you need to put in
more upfront if you have that money. And
what about if you could only budget for
100 a month, then, as you can see, you
need an even larger initial investment
to stay on track to start with. What I'm
doing here is just playing out scenarios
on how much I need to invest lump sum or
monthly based on the rate of return I'm
expecting the goal amount and the number
of years I have to reach that goal
amount. And then the beauty here is
flexibility. So let's say your big goal
is you want to reach 1 million with the
same 7% return. The calculator says you
need to invest 500 monthly. But wait,
your budget from section one that you've
done shows you only have 300 a month
available to invest. That that
difference between what your 500 that
you need to invest and the 300 that you
actually have available. That's your
investment gap. Ideal investment amount
500 a month. That's what you need to hit
your goal. Your realistic investment
amount, the 300 a month, which is what
you can actually afford right now. And
then your investment gap, which is the
difference, that's 200 a month. That is
very normal. There's investment gap in
most cases and recognizing it shouldn't
be discouraging. It's actually a huge
step forward because now instead of just
saving aimlessly in the hope that you'll
get there, you now have concrete numbers
to work with and so many ways to
actually bridge that gap. You can now
think about potentially extending that
timeline. So, could you reach your goal
in 32 or 35 years instead of 30? You
could also think about optimizing your
return. So, could you consider
investments with slightly higher
potential returns whilst keeping your
risk appropriate? and we're going to
talk about that in the next section.
What about start with a higher initial
lump sum if you have that available? Or
maybe it's just something or a situation
where you're gradually going to increase
your contributions over time as your
income grows. So, you're going to direct
more towards closing this gap over the
years. Potentially, you might even be
looking at ways to increase your salary.
What matters most is that you've
transformed a very vague financial goal
that maybe you just thought of today and
you put numbers into it and now you can
track your progress towards that goal
and you can adjust and you could
eventually achieve that goal. What
you'll also need to do is remember to
look up the tax rules for the country
that you live in and start matching your
investments with those rules. I have a
video right here. It's another topic in
itself about how to pay less tax which
you can check out as well after this
video. These can significantly boost
your progress towards closing that gap
because the less you pay away, the more
you get to keep. The bottom line here is
when you know your numbers, your dreams
then can become plans. And plans have a
funny way of becoming reality. Now,
let's move on to the different
investment strategies you can explore to
optimize that rate of return for you and
your personality. And here's the thing,
main thing that I want you to take away.
You should not be investing the same
throughout your entire life. Your
priorities will change, your risks will
change, and your investment strategy
should change with them. For instance,
when you're in your 20s or 30s and
you're decades away from retirement,
time is your greatest asset. You can
afford, therefore, to take more risk
because even if the market drops, you
have years to recover before you need
that money. But as you get older and you
get closer to retirement, which is when
you're going to need that money,
especially if you're saving
predominantly to retire on it, the focus
starts to shift. You're not just trying
to grow your money anymore. You're
trying to protect it. And that's where
wealth preservation becomes more
important than wealth accumulation, i.e.
wealth growth. So how do you decide what
of your portfolio should be preservation
and what part should be growth? So
here's a very basic way to look at it.
take your age and round it up to the
nearest five. So it will end in
something with a five or something that
ends in a zero. Now you're going to take
that number and you're going to subtract
10 from it. That is the percentage of
your portfolio that should be in bonds
and everything else should be in
equities. So say I'm 32, that rounds up
to 35. 35 minus 10 is 25. So 20% of my
portfolio should be in bonds and the
remaining the remaining 75% should be in
equities. If I'm 58, that rounds up to
60. 60 minus 10, half of my portfolio
should be in bonds and the other half
should be in stocks, equities. Then as
you age, you gradually shift more of
your portfolio towards the preservation
to protect the wealth that you've then
grown and accumulated over your working
years. So that's one way to look at it.
It's not perfect, but it's a very
helpful baseline. Personally, I wouldn't
stop there. your comfort with risk and
your ability to essentially sleep at
night when markets get volatile matters
just as much. Some people who are in
their 30s get anxious with a 20% market
drop, while some people in their 50s
handle it completely fine and with ease.
So, this is why understanding your own
risk tolerance is also really important
for building a strategy that you'll
actually stick to and not feel like you
need to sell when things get bumpy.
Additionally, on this note, one of the
biggest dangers I see is concentration
risk, which is essentially when
someone's portfolio gets so heavy on one
thing without them realizing. And uh a
big risk here is actually company stock
options. So if your company's given you
stock, has given you stock as part of
your compensation. Do ask yourself, is
this becoming too large of a percentage
of my overall portfolio? And do I truly
believe in the company's long-term
prospects? Because sometimes if it's too
heavily based on that, you might want to
derisk, i.e. sell a little bit of that
and then transfer that money into other
investments that make more sense for
you. But again, this is all about
understanding your own risk and your own
appetite. Personal finance, it's
personal. There is no one-sizefits all
answers, but you do want to understand
what your risks are, how close you are
to retirement, and your risk appetite.
And ultimately, that will determine how
your portfolio looks and what the
percentages need to be. This helps you
build a sustainable portfolio that makes
sure that you're going to be fine no
matter what happens in the market. Okay,
moving on to section nine, car buying
and how much can you actually afford.
With the average person spending 15 to
20% of their annual income on their car,
transportation falls into one of the top
three expenses in our daily life with
the average person spending between 15
to 20% of their annual income on it.
Transportation is also one of the
biggest wealth drainers. So, I wanted to
make sure we cover this off in the video
and we're going to go through what is
the most efficient way to buy a car and
what guidelines can we follow to make
sure we're not paying more than we can
actually afford. So, let's go firstly
through the main rules and the main
guidelines when it comes to buying a car
and how much you should spend depending
on your salary. The first guideline here
is a 25 to 35 approach. This method is
all about balancing your love for cars,
if you have one, with your other
financial needs. If you're more frugal
and buying a car doesn't you don't
really care what car you drive and
you're also on the start of your car
ownership journey, then according to
this approach, the lower end, the 25% of
your pre-tax annual salary should be
your target for a car purchase. On the
other hand, if buying a car sits up high
in your priorities, you're willing to
trim down on other areas of your life to
accommodate for an additional or higher
expense for a car because you love cars
or whatever other reason, then you may
be able to push that budget up to 35% of
your annual income. So, what do those
numbers mean in practice? If you're
bringing in 60,000 a year, let's say,
then you're looking at a price tag
ranging between 15,000 and 21,000 for
your car. If you're on a salary of
100,000 a year, then the sweet spot for
a new car purchase lies between 25,000
and 35,000 depending on which part of
the 25% to 35% you fall into. This isn't
a hard and fast rule, but it's a
guideline to keep you from overdoing it.
The next guideline you can consider is
the 2410 approach, which is a very
simple yet really effective strategy
when making a wise car purchase. So the
20 that represents the down payment you
should be making on your car. So, let's
say you're eyeing up a 30,000 car. That
means 6,000 of that should be your down
payment. 20% of 30,000. If you're not
able to afford 6,000, then you want to
look for a car that's cheaper. Below
that bracket so that you can afford to
put down 20% of the car price. Next, the
four that represents the term of the car
loan. So, simply put, you should aim to
pay off your car loan in no more than 4
years, i.e. 48 months. This helps you to
reduce the amount of interest that
you'll pay over the term of the loan and
it also helps make sure you don't end up
underwater on your loan, i.e. owing more
on your car than it's actually worth.
And then the final, the 10, that's the
portion of your total monthly income
that should be allocated to car
expenses. This includes not only your
monthly car payment, but also things
like maintenance and insurance. So say
you earn 60,000 a year or 5,000 a month
following that 2410 approach. Your car
related expenses shouldn't go over 500 a
month. That's a 10. So to illustrate how
all of this works in practice, let's
consider two approaches. One is a common
approach that people often do and then
the other one follows a very strict 2410
guideline. So scenario one, let's say
you find a car that you love and it's
priced at 25,000. You don't make a down
payment, so you actually finance the
entire amount. Your loan has an interest
rate, I'm assuming, of just under 8%.
But instead of sticking to a four-year
term loan, you decide to stretch out
that term loan to 5 years, 60 months. So
this means your monthly car payments
would be just over 500 a month, bringing
the total cost of the car, the amount
that you're paying over the 5 years to
over 30,000. And over 5,000 of that is
paid in interest alone. Now, let's look
at scenario two. And for this one,
you're following the 2410 rule. So for
this, you buy the same 25,000 car and
this time you make a 20% down payment.
So you put down 5,000. The interest rate
we're assuming is the same. So we're
comparing side by side, assuming an 8%
interest rate, but you decide to stick
to a 4-year term loan, 48 months. So
your monthly payments will now actually
be lower, around
488 a month. Not only that, the total
cost that you pay in interest over the
loan drops. So instead of 5,400, it's
about 3,400. That's almost 2,000 less.
If we look at the total impact, the
total cost of the car using the 2410
rule, it is just under
28,500 compared to 30,000 if you weren't
using the rule. So that's the saving you
would have and how it would work if you
simply followed the 2410 rule or even a
variation of it. And then you have the
cash approach. And that leads me to the
third strategy. One of the benefits of
buying a car outright is that you
completely eliminate the need for
financing, saving you from paying any
interest whatsoever. It sounds simple,
but depending on the car that you're
buying, this approach requires a lot of
money up front, which can firstly derail
your emergency fund or any other saving
goals that you have planned. And
secondly, the reality is a lot of people
don't have a large chunk like 25,000
just sitting in their bank account ready
to be spent on a car. So there's a
middle ground and this follows the
principles of fiscal prudence. One
alternative is to buy a secondhand car
outright using what you would have spent
on a down payment of a new car. So
referring back to the previous scenario,
this would mean spending 5,000 on a car
outright. Yes, the car you get for 5,000
might not be anything special at all or
the latest model in anything, but this
is about trade-offs and the benefit of
delayed gratification. Because if you
look at the secondhand car approach over
the 4year term, so the same period we
were looking at for the 2410 rule, if
you had been paying 488 a month for a
new car over 4 years, that amounts to
28,000 in total. But instead, if you use
5,000 of that to buy a car outright, and
let's assume for simplicity, you saved
the rest. Then by the end of year four,
you would have saved up enough to
potentially afford to buy a 23,000 car
outright in cash after four years.
Again, eliminating the need for any
financing. So essentially, by spending
less now, you have the potential to
afford more in the future whilst also
paying less in interest and minimizing
your exposure to debt. That is the
benefit of delayed gratification. And
this is the route that I'm currently
taking. But ultimately, these are all
guidelines. Ultimately, it comes down to
how important is car ownership for you,
how it fits into your overall budget and
overall lifestyle as well. And one more
thing to add, if you're buying for a car
dealership, they will do everything they
can to fit your monthly payment into
your budget without showing you the
total cost of what you're paying for a
car. It's extremely important when
buying a car to always calculate the
total cost of ownership. All the
interest fees, the interest, the hidden
costs. I've got a full video on
calculating the true cost of ownership
and what to look out for. I'll link it
here so you can make a decision when it
comes to the financial side of your car
with complete confidence. And finally,
moving on to the last section, which is
should you buy or rent a home. This is
one of the most important questions of
your financial life. It is one of the
biggest financial commitments you are
going to make. So, let's cover
everything you need to consider to make
your decision. We're going to start with
the financial things to consider. And
then we're going to move on to the
psychological aspects. And bear in mind,
this is a huge topic with so many
variants. And I've tried to keep it as
simple as possible to cover the things
that you need to consider and how to go
about thinking when it comes to this
decision. So, first off, let's talk
about the sunk costs. When people think,
I'm buying a 400,000 home, they usually
think it's just 400,000. But actually,
there's so many one-off costs that you
pay for the house that you don't get any
money back from. There are four main
hidden costs or sunk costs when buying a
house. The first is property taxes. This
depends on your country. In the UK, as
stamp duty in the US, it's statebased
tax. Second thing is legal fees. You'll
need to pay a solicitor to handle things
like transferring the ownership,
checking documents, sorting out planning
permissions. The third is evaluation
fee. This is what you pay your mortgage
lender to assess the value of the home.
And then based on that, the mortgage
provider will decide how much they will
lend you. And then there are other small
fees which I'll just bucket into
miscellaneous which think about mortgage
arrangement fees, surveyor fees, and
these all also add up. So these
transaction costs, they're one-off
costs. You don't get any money back from
them. And they could add up to thousands
that you would never recover regardless
of how your property investment
performs. And most people forget about
them or they don't really add it up into
the total cost. But you really need to
consider this because it impacts the
break even timeline when comparing
buying versus renting. Now, if you're
renting, the sunk costs are so much
simpler. You've got your monthly rent.
So, let's say you're paying 1,500 for a
one bed in London. That is your sunk
cost. You're paying for living, but
you're not getting money back from it.
And then you might have, if you're
relocating, the cost of relocation,
that's another sunk cost. The next
financial cost to consider are
maintenance costs. How does it compare
between buying and renting? A rule of
thumb when it comes to owning a home,
take 1% of your home's value and that is
the amount that you can spend on
maintenance every year. So if your home
value is 400,000, then assume 4,000
towards maintenance on a annual basis
depending on the age and the condition
of your home. Whereas if you rent, you
are not on the hook for maintenance.
That is the landlord's responsibility.
be sure you need to pay a security
deposit up front and that can
potentially be held back from you
depending on the condition you return
the flat in, but you are not actually
paying for the ongoing maintenance.
Another big thing to consider is the
opportunity costs. Before we get into
that, I want to explain how this works.
When you're buying a home, there are two
big financial costs that you need to
wrap your head around. The first is the
down payment. That's a chunk of the
purchase price that you pay upfront
straight from your bank account. And
it's usually around 20% of your home's
value. So, if you're buying a 400,000
home, you need to pay 80,000 upfront.
That's the first one. The second cost is
the mortgage repayment. So, this is the
money you need to borrow from the bank
to cover the remaining 80% of the
purchase price. So, in this case, the
remaining 80% of that 400,000 home is
320,000. And then you pay that back over
time with interest. So, let's say your
mortgage rate is 5% and you plan to pay
it off over 20 years. That means your
monthly payment would be roughly
2,100 per month. And over 20 years,
you'd end up repaying around 506,000 in
total, of which 320,000 is the
principal, and that's the amount you
borrowed. And then the remaining
186,000. That's the interest. That's the
interest that you're paying to the bank
for lending you money. Okay. So, now
I've explained that, let's look at the
opportunity cost. On the plus side, in
most cities, the value of your home will
appreciate. So let's say the value of
your 400,000 home grows at 3% per year.
After 10 years, that house would be
worth about
537,000. So you've gained roughly
137,000 in value from appreciation. But
on the flip side, you had to spend the
80,000 upfront for the down payment and
you committed to monthly mortgage
payments and you could have spent that
money somewhere else instead. For
instance, you could have put that
amount, that 80,000 deposit, and the
remaining mortgage repayments. You could
have invested that same money into the
stock market or another investment. If
you put it into the stock market,
assuming it grows at 7% per year, which
is the historical average for the S&P
500, taking into account inflation, then
you would have 157,000, which is a
profit of
77,000. But you do still have to think
about where you're going to live. What
are you going to rent? Because you still
have to live somewhere. And then that's
another cost that you have to take into
account. Whereas, when you're buying,
you don't have to think about rent
because your mortgage is paying off the
principal as well, which is gradually
adding to your net worth, as we spoke
about in the assets and liability
section of this video. So, if you're
weighing up the opportunity cost from
renting versus buying, the main question
we really want to ask ourselves is, what
would I be doing with that money if I
didn't put it towards a down payment for
a house? And secondly, what would leave
me with more wealth in 2 years, 5 years,
or 10 years time? This has so many
moving parts to it. There's so many
costs to consider. And I know you've
probably heard this so much, but there
really is so specific to what you're
going to do with that money and where
you're going to invest it and what house
and what area you buy. Now, those are
the financial things to consider. There
are also psychological things because
buying gives you stability and you
cannot put a price on that. You won't be
asked to leave by a landlord. You can do
whatever you want to the house. You can
convert the loft. You could drill holes
in the wall and you don't have to ask
your landlord specifically at least for
permission. You can't do that with
renting. And for a lot of people, just
the psychological comfort of having a
house way exceeds the financial costs or
the one-off costs that come with it.
Feeling like you have a place to
yourself and you won't have to keep
moving around and relocating. On the
other hand, renting offers a huge amount
of flexibility. You can move to a bigger
place. You can move to a smaller place.
You could test out new areas. You could
relocate easily. and you don't have to
worry about fixing anything or the
maintenance because that's looked after
by the landlord. People might just
believe that buying is always better
than renting because from our parents
generation that usually was always the
case. But unfortunately, it's not the
case in this generation. Markets change,
interest rates fluctuate. What worked in
the past may not be the optimal strategy
today. So, if you're deciding between
buying and renting, hopefully that gives
you a framework to think about. Consider
your specific financial situation, the
market conditions, the lifestyle needs,
and the long-term goals rather than
simply following conventional wisdom.
So, that is it. That covers pretty much
everything you need to know to get
started and to build your foundations
with financial literacy. You can come
back anytime and watch this video again.
It will stay on this channel. If you do
want to check out any of the tools, the
guides, the calculators that were
featured in this video, they are part of
my financial well-being toolkit. This is
a tool kit designed to help you manage
your money like the top 1%. And what you
saw today, the templates that you saw,
it's about 5% of what's actually
included. You get your financial
dashboard to keep you on track with your
progress, including your income, your
spending, your monthly check-ins, your
debt, your goals, your investments. It's
all in one place. You also get access to
10 interactive workbooks that you can
tackle at your own pace. The idea is to
take your finances from complete chaos
to complete clarity. They're filled with
quizzes, with self assessments, with
calculators at the end of each section.
In there, you will find everything you
need to build a really solid financial
plan that will help you turn your dreams
into reality. You can find more
information on
nisha.me/plan for all of the details or
there's a link in the video description
as well. And there is currently an early
access code for the first 500 people.
Thank you for watching.
